# 0x04. Typescript
In this project, we will learn about Typescript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. We will learn about its basic types, interfaces, classes, functions, how to work with the DOM, generic types, namespaces, merging declarations, ambient namespaces to import external libraries, and basic nominal typing.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we will be able to:

- Explain the basic types in Typescript
- Define interfaces, classes, and functions in Typescript
- Use Typescript to interact with the DOM
- Work with generic types in Typescript
- Use namespaces in Typescript to organize our code
- Merge declarations in Typescript
- Import external libraries using ambient namespaces in Typescript
- Explain basic nominal typing in Typescript

## Requirements
To work with Typescript, we will need to install it globally on our machine:

```
npm install -g typescript
```
We will also need a text editor or IDE that supports Typescript, such as Visual Studio Code or WebStorm.

## Project Structure
The project will have the following structure:

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, we will need to clone the repository from GitHub:

After navigating to the project directory, we will need to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```
We will also need to compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:
